# Sales and Order Data Analytics - Empowering Business Insights

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing a comprehensive data analysis of sales and order data to extract actionable business insights. Utilizing a robust set of tools including Python for data manipulation, SQL for database management, and Power BI for interactive visualizations, the project aims to transform raw transactional data into meaningful intelligence. The core objective is to understand sales performance, identify customer purchasing patterns, analyze revenue trends, and track product returns to support informed decision-making.

The project addresses challenges in data quality, feature engineering, and data visualization to provide a holistic view of the business operations derived from the `order_dataset.csv`.

## Features

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Robust handling of missing values, date format standardization, and removal of duplicate records using Pandas.
* **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new, insightful features like an 'Is Return' flag to easily identify and analyze returned items.
* **SQL Database Integration**: Demonstrates the capability to load and query large datasets efficiently within a SQL environment.
* **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Derives key sales metrics such as total revenue, final revenue, sales tax, purchased, and refunded item counts.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Development of a dynamic Power BI dashboard for intuitive visualization and exploration of sales trends, product performance, and return analysis.
* **Time-Series Analysis**: Ability to analyze sales and order trends over time.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**:
    * **Pandas**: For data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and feature engineering.
    * **Matplotlib**: For static data visualization (if specific plots were generated in Python).
    * **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical data visualization (if specific plots were generated in Python).
* **SQL (MySQL/SQLite)**: For database setup, data storage, and querying.
    * The project includes SQL scripts (`Project_5.sql`) for database interactions.
* **Power BI**: For creating interactive and dynamic business intelligence dashboards.
* **VS Code**: Integrated Development Environment for coding and script management.
